# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new or minimal Twitter-related project with only an empty `db/` directory structure currently in place.

## Current Structure

- `db/` - Database-related directory (currently empty)

## Development Notes

This is a minimal codebase that appears to be in early setup stages. No build tools, package managers, or configuration files are currently present. When developing in this repository:

- This is not a git repository yet - initialize with `git init` if version control is needed
- No package.json exists - add one if this becomes a Node.js project
- No build or test commands are available yet
- The project structure suggests this may be intended as a Twitter clone or related application

Future instances should expect to help set up the initial project structure, including choosing appropriate frameworks, build tools, and development workflows based on the specific requirements provided by the user.
